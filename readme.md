# PHP Spintax Viewer

Spintax comes from the word "spinning syntax." It is the format used by article spinner softwares as well as article submission sites which produce or use spun articles, usually for SEO purposes.

For example, the sentence:

`"The most commonly used acne treatments in the U.S are over the counter acne medications."`

Could become:

`The most {commonly used|popular|widely used|common|frequently used} acne treatments in the U.S. {are|tend to be|are usually|are generally|usually are} over the counter acne medications.`

The curly braces encompass the texts which can be chosen randomly, and could result into:

`The most popular acne treatments in the U.S. tend to be over the counter acne medications.`

`The widely used acne treatments in the U.S. are usually over the counter acne medications.`

`The frequently used acne treatments in the U.S. usually are over the counter acne medications.`

And so on.

The resulting or spun articles have texts from the original article randomly changed while retaining the overall meaning.

Submitted spun articles will look unique to search engines.
